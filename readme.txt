Reilly Cannon - Traveling Salesperson Project Part 1 - README

I created a class cities, in cities.hh and cities.cc that are used to solve the traveling salesperson problem by randomly guessing permutations of cities and checking if their distance is better than the current best distance so far. I implement the full methon in tsp.cc, which can be run from the command line on a list of city coordinates given in a .tsv file, using the command:

$ .\tsp <my_cities>.tsv

I also included my results for running this on the "challenge.tsv" file.
